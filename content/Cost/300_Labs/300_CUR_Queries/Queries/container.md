CUR Query Library uses placeholder variables, indicated by a dollar sign and curly braces (**${  }**). **${table_name}** and **${date_filter}** are common placeholder variables used throughout CUR Query Library, which must be replaced before a query will run. For example, if your CUR table is called **cur_table** and is in a database called **cur_db**, you would replace **${table_name}** with **cur_db.cur_table**. For **${date_filter}**, you have multiple options. See [Filtering by Date]({{< ref "/Cost/300_labs/300_CUR_Queries/Query_Help#filtering-by-date" >}}) in the CUR Query Library Help section for additional details.

### Amazon Elastic Container Services

#### Query Description
This query will output the daily cost and usage per resource, by operation and service, for Elastic Consainer Services, ECS and EKS, both unblended and amortized costs are shown.  To provide you with a complete picture of the data, to match totals in cost explorer, if you are using Savings Plans you will likely see results with *blank* resource IDs, these represent the Savings Plans Negation values for compute cost already covered by Savings Plans.

#### Pricing

### Amazon ECS Split Cost Allocation Data

#### Query Description
The cost allocation data generated by Amazon ECS split cost allocation analyzes the resource consumption of each container running on an EC2 instance. It calculates costs by considering the amortized cost of the instance and the proportion of CPU and memory resources utilized by the containers.

Once split cost allocation data is  [configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/enabling-split-cost-allocation-data.html), the AWS Cost and Usage Report will include additional columns that provide detailed insights into container-level costs. These columns offer a comprehensive breakdown of the costs associated with individual containers and their respective resource consumption.  Without these columns, this query will generate errors.  

Two new usage records are added for each ECS task per hour as a result, the Cost and Usage Report may be significantly larger after enabling ECS Split Cost Allocation.  This [published calculation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/split-cost-allocation-data.html) allows customers to estimate the number of new lines.
